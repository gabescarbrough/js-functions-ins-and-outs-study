## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I'm confused how to actually use callback functions. I can see why they are useful,
but I had a hard time following along for some of the examples. Particularly the examples
that use jQuery as I have very limited experience with jQuery.

Similarly, for function declarations vs function expressions, I had a hard time
following along for all of the examples. I'm not sure I fully understand exactly
how scope and hoisting work.

I also don't think I really understand closures.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
What are some real-life examples of when you would use a function declaration vs
a function expression?
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel good about my progress as a developer thus far. There are definitely concepts
I am still figuring out, and not everything clicks right away but I've learned a whole
lot for just a week.

I think it would be helpful if the lectures moved a bit slower. When Lauren is leading
I am able to keep up, but sometimes when Jason and Antony are lecturing a new concept
or useful information is moved to while I am still processing what was just introduced
and I feel like I am missing something until I ask questions to circle back to what was just said.

I'm hoping I will have time this weekend to go over what we learned this week and review.
For much of what we learned I feel like I am 80% of the way to where I want to be, and
giving it more time will get me where I want to be.
